# Healthcare Data Analysis Interface

This project is designed to help you build an interactive healthcare data analysis interface using HTML and JavaScript. The goal is to create a dynamic front-end system where patient data can be collected, processed, and analyzed. You will learn important concepts of DOM manipulation, data-driven decision making, and dynamic report generation in healthcare analytics.

## What You Will Learn

- **Interactive Data Input Interface**: Develop and use HTML forms to collect and validate patient data, including text, numbers, radio buttons, and dropdown inputs.
  
- **Data Processing and Analysis**: Manage patient data using JavaScript by storing it in arrays of objects, applying search and filter techniques based on health conditions, and analyzing the data.

- **Dynamic Report Generation**: Dynamically generate reports within a webpage that reflect the processed data, presenting statistical insights and ensuring data-driven decision making.

- **User Interaction and Event Handling**: Learn to respond to user-triggered events such as button clicks and navigation links, allowing for dynamic search queries and report updates.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you will be able to:

1. Create an interactive interface using HTML forms to collect various types of patient data.
2. Process and analyze data using JavaScript, including filtering data based on health conditions and dynamically updating content.
3. Generate and display dynamic reports within a webpage, using DOM manipulation to present statistical insights.
4. Handle user events, such as button clicks, to trigger data searches and updates.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, make sure you have:

- Basic knowledge of HTML and GitHub.
